        Pests that are targets of genetic pest control would likely be the most damaging pests to our ecosystem. Rats, possums, and stoats are among these high priority pests. They are known to cause severe damage to native plant life, and bird life. Furthermore, they are among the hardest to control as there are not many methods of eradicating them outside of 1080 poison and traps.

Rats, primarily ship rats and Norway rats, are a major threat to New Zealand’s ecosystems. Rats are known to eat native insects such as fruit, flowers, wētā, snails, eggs, chicks, and lizards. Rats in New Zealand do have natural predators that were also introduced such as stoats and feral cats, however due to abundance of prey for them they do not usually target rats allowing them to thrive.<br>

The common brushtail possum was first introduced in New Zealand in 1837 to establish a fur trade. The initial release was unsuccessful, and so another at the same location in southland was made which successfully established them in New Zealand. Since then they have severely damaged New Zealand’s delicate ecosystem. Their natural predators are largely absent allowing them to decimate plant life and occupy nesting area that could be used by native birds such as kākāriki. Possums are opportunistic omnivores meaning they eat mainly leaves but also can eat flowers and even bird eggs and hatchlings. This drives up food competition for native birds making it harder for their populations to stabilise.<br>

        <br>
Stoats were introduced to control rabbit populations after they started destroying crops, in the 1880s. They were largely ineffective at this as they could survive off the native bird life. New Zealand had only two types of native mammal bats and seals, neither of which hunted native birds as a food source. Due to this, native birds evolved to avoid sight-based predators such as eagles and falcons by freezing and staying still, making them hard to see. However, stoats and other introduced predators hunt by smell, so native flightless birds, such as kiwi and kakapo, did not have a method of protecting themselves from these new predators. This allowed stoats to decimate their population.
         <br><br>
Genetic pest control will target such threats detailed and eradicate them effectively allowing New Zealand to be pest free.
